# hello-world
try to get into it
I screwed my Harvard summer school a little bit, mainly because I donot have time for completing the assignments
I was having my my finals last week and trying to get an internship this week
But I do feel that I need to re-consider my priorities at present - as I paid for Harvard and I don't like being treated as the dumb kid at class.
